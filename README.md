# movies

Our project will be a database website around our favorite movies. We will be utilizing all the elements we have learned in class this year including html, jquery, javascript, and bootstrap.

Our database will have three tables: movies, actor, actress. The movie table will contain 6 columns with variables named: movieID, title, genre, year, actor, actress. The actress and actor table will both contain the same five variables: ID, first name, last name, age, moviesID. The relationship between movies and the other two tables are 1:M. For example, we are assuming that each movie can only have one and only one actor or actress but each actor/actress can star in more than one movie.
